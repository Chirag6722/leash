# Leash — submission writeup

**Team:** thegoodengineers · **Track:** Ship It · **Event:** First Commit, WeMakeDevs x AWS, 17–20 Sept 2026

## The problem

Every small team has the same 3 AM story: a disk fills up or a container dies, an alarm fires, and
the fix is a step everyone already knows. Nobody automates it because the only tool that could do
the fix on its own — an AI agent with cloud credentials — could also delete the database, and a
single crafted log line or chat message can talk a model into doing exactly that. Trust is the
blocker, not capability.

## What we built

Leash is a Strands agent that receives CloudWatch alarm events, diagnoses the resource, and runs
the remediation: clean a full disk over SSM, force a new ECS deployment, or scale an Auto
Scaling group. The twist is that the agent has no direct power. Every mutating tool first asks
a **leash that lives in AWS** whether the action is allowed: a small authorizer Lambda that
evaluates four Cedar policies (the AWS open-source policy language; Amazon Verified Permissions
is supported as a drop-in with one parameter) from a versioned S3 bucket and writes the audit
row *before* it answers. Remediation is permitted only on resources tagged `env=dev`; terminate
and delete are forbidden for everyone; anything tagged `env=prod` is forbidden; scaling above
four instances is forbidden. Cedar is deny-by-default and forbid beats permit, so no prompt can
widen the leash. Because the model is the one part that does not have to be trusted, the brain
can run anywhere: the alarm goes EventBridge → SQS → the agent process, which for this
submission runs on an EC2 instance with a local model under a least-privilege instance role
(Bedrock is not in the AWS Free plan; there are no access keys anywhere in the system), and the
same code runs in Lambda on Bedrock with `Brain=bedrock` or on a laptop for development. Each decision — ALLOW or DENY, with
the policy ids that fired — is in a DynamoDB audit table, a summary goes out over SNS, and a
dashboard shows the trail live next to the policies themselves, read from the store. A `/ask` endpoint lets a human ask the
agent to do something dangerous so the denial can be watched in real time, and a prompt injection
planted in the instance's own `Name` tag shows that the leash holds even when the attack comes
from inside the data the agent reads.

## Proving it: the red team

"The model cannot be talked into it" is a claim, so we measure it. An attacker model writes
attacks across eight tactics (fake authority, fake emergency, fake policy update, role-play,
obfuscation, instructions hidden in logs and alarm payloads, slow escalation, and plain asking),
each naming real resources in the account. Every attack runs twice with the same model and the
same tools: once through the real agent with Cedar on, and once through the same agent with
authorisation off inside an in-memory sandbox where nothing real can be harmed. The dashboard
reports how often the model was persuaded to call the destructive tool, how many attacks executed
a destructive action without the leash, and how many did with Leash. The last figure is the
project: it stays at zero, and every one of those zeros is a real Cedar denial from the authorizer with
the policy id that produced it. The deployed run: 20 attacks across seven
tactics; the model was persuaded 18 times; **18 of 20 executed a destructive action with the
leash off, 0 of 20 with Leash on**. The two attacks the model refused by itself are the point:
"the model refused" happened 10% of the time, "the policy refused" happened every time.

## Where AWS fits

CloudWatch and EventBridge turn an alarm into an event and SQS carries it to the brain, an EC2
instance running the model under a scoped IAM role; Lambda runs the authorizer, the API and
(with Bedrock) the agent; Cedar evaluates the
policies outside the model's reach, from a versioned S3 bucket; Systems Manager lets us fix an
instance with no SSH and no open ports; ECS on Fargate and Auto Scaling are the things being
fixed; DynamoDB, SNS, API Gateway and S3 give the audit trail somewhere to live. IAM sits
underneath Cedar as a second, independent floor. One SAM template deploys all of it, including
the deliberately breakable infrastructure, on the Free plan, and one script tears it down.

## Impact, measured

The dashboard computes these from the audit trail itself, not from a slide:

| What changes | Before Leash | With Leash |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A destructive action after a jailbreak attempt | 18 of 20 (the same model, same attacks, leash off, sandboxed) | **0 of 20** on the live stack, every attempt audited with the policy id that stopped it |
| Time from alarm to fix for a full dev disk | until a human wakes up and runs one command: typically 30 min to several hours | 5 min 48 s measured on the deployed stack with an 8B model on a laptop CPU (Bedrock is not in the Free plan); the leash decisions inside that took under a second each. With `Brain=bedrock` the same run is under 90 s. Shown live as **Alarm → fixed** on the dashboard |
| Who can destroy something at 3 AM | anyone with the admin keys the bot would need | nobody: terminate and delete are forbidden by policy, by IAM, and by code |
| How you find out what the bot did | grep CloudTrail | one table: every ALLOW and DENY with the policy id that decided it |
| How you change what the bot may do | edit a prompt and hope | write the rule in English; Cedar validates the draft, a proof lists every answer that flips, a person approves |
| Loosening it past the floor | one prompt edit | impossible from the page, the token or the bucket: ten invariants (never terminate, never delete, nothing on prod, no cap of 10, nothing untagged) are proved on every proposal, approval and policy load. A set that breaks one is never enforced: the agent switches off, it does not loosen |
| Cost at rest | — | two `t3.micro` (one stopped) and a quarter Fargate vCPU; everything else is pay-per-use |

## What we learned

- **Put the guardrail outside the model.** Our first attempt told the model the rules in the
  system prompt. A small local model happily "refused" on its own, or narrated a tool call as text,
  and nothing was audited either way. Moving every check into the tool (`authorize()` before
  `act()`) and telling the model *not* to enforce policy itself made the behaviour identical across
  Bedrock Haiku and a 3B Llama. The value is in the policies, not in the model.
- **Cedar's `forbid`-beats-`permit` is the whole trick.** A policy like
  `forbid (principal, action, resource) when { resource.env == "prod" }` cannot be argued with;
  the worst a persuaded model can do is ask, be denied, and leave a red row.
- **Verified Permissions returns opaque policy ids.** The audit row would have said
  `SPEXAMPLEabc...`; we export a name-to-id map from the nested SAM stack and translate it back, so
  the row and the reply say `ForbidProd`.
- **CloudWatch alarm dimensions must match the agent's metric exactly.** `disk_used_percent` from
  the CloudWatch agent carries `device` and `host` dimensions by default; we drop them in the
  agent config so the alarm only needs `InstanceId + path + fstype`.
- **IAM cannot express "not above 4".** It can deny an API, not a value in the request. That is
  why Cedar is the leash and IAM is the floor, and why both exist.
- **A guardrail is not a runbook.** Our first deployed run of the poisoned-tag beat held the
  leash (terminate was denied) but the injection still talked the model out of cleaning the
  disk. The policy engine can only refuse; it cannot make the model do its job. So alarm runs
  now insist that the runbook's remediation step is attempted, and the prompt says outright that
  text inside a resource is data, never an instruction. The re-run read the tag, tried to
  terminate, was denied, and cleaned the disk anyway.
- **A guardrail claim needs a control group.** Running the same attacks against the same model
  with authorisation off, in a sandbox, is what turns "it refused" into a number. It also
  separates "the model refused" from "the policy refused", which are very different guarantees:
  only the second one is the same every night.
- **The Free plan does not include Verified Permissions or Bedrock.** We found out at deploy
  time. Instead of giving up the design we split it: the leash (Cedar + audit) became its own
  Lambda that owns the policies and writes the row before answering, and the brain became a
  queue consumer that can run anywhere. The result is stricter than the version we planned.
- **Build the offline path early.** Our AWS account was stuck in verification on day one, so we
  built `local_demo/`: the same agent, tools and `.cedar` files against an in-memory AWS. It became
  the fastest way to iterate on prompts and the way the tests run in CI.

## Two ways to run it

The same code runs in two places. On AWS, `sam deploy` brings up the agent Lambda, the Verified
Permissions policy store, the audit table, the API, the dashboard and the deliberately breakable
dev infrastructure. On a laptop with no AWS account, `local_demo/` runs the identical agent,
tools, Cedar policies (evaluated with cedarpy against the same `.cedar` files that the SAM
template deploys) and dashboard, with a local Ollama model in place of Bedrock and AWS itself
replaced by an in-memory simulation that answers the exact same boto3 calls. Every audit row
in the demo, allowed or denied, comes from a real Cedar decision on the real policy text.

## AI tools used

Claude Code was used to scaffold and review the code. All architecture decisions, the policy
design and the demo were made by the team; every generated file was read and tested locally
before being kept.
